        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Chemical Reaction Toolkit is a suite of tools written in Javascript that perform basic analysis of chemical reaction networks from the comfort of your web browser, without needing to install any software.</p>
        <p>At present, the toolkit provides a convenient parser for reaction networks and efficient algorithms for computing the full set of conservation laws.<!-- and extreme pathways in a network. It can additionally report the deficiency of the network, as well as perform some flux balance analysis.</p>
        <p>In addition, the network and calculations can be exported to various programming environments and file formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SBML file</li>
            <li>Graphviz DOT file</li>
            <li>Python3/SciPy code</li>
            <li>Julia/Catalyst.jl code</li>
        </ul>--></p>

        <h2>Review the Chemical Reaction Network</h2>
        <p>Please review CRNTK's "understanding" of your chemical reaction network before proceeding.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you may provide specific names for each reaction: these names will be reflected in the various exported files that are available. (Note that a reversible reaction named "Rxn" will implicitly generate "Rxn_f" and "Rxn_b" in these files, referring to the forward and backward reactions separately.)</p>
